In the year 513 , in the reign of Severus , and in the reign of Abgar the king , son of Maano the king , in the month <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/2392">Tis</a>hrin the latter -LRB- i. e. , November -RRB- , the fountain of water which proceeds from the great palace of Abgar the great king increased , and it prevailed , and it went up according to its former manner , and overflowed and ran out on all sides , so that the courts and the porches and the royal houses began to be filled with water .
</p>
        <p>
And when our lord Abgar the king saw it , he went up to the level ground on the hill above his palace , where dwell and reside those who do the work for the government .
</p>
        <p>
And while the wise men considered what to do to the waters which had so greatly increased , it happened that there was a great and violent rain in the night , and the Daisan -LRB- river -RRB- came , neither in its day , nor in its month .
</p>
        <p>
And strange waters came ; and they encountered the cataracts -LRB- ?
</p>
        <p>
flood gates -RRB- which were fastened with great pieces of iron which were overlaid upon them , and with bars of iron which supported them .
</p>
        <p>
But not prevailing against them , the waters rose like a great sea beyond the walls of the city .
</p>
        <p>
And the waters began to come down from the apertures of the wall into the city .
</p>
        <p>
And Abgar the king stood on the great tower which was called that of the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/526">Persia</a>ns , and saw the water by the light of torches , and he commanded , and they took away the gates and the eight cataracts -LRB- ?
</p>
        <p>
flood-gates -RRB- of the western wall of the city where the river flowed out .
</p>
        <p>
But that very hour the waters broke down the western wall of the city , and entered the city , and overthrew the great and beautiful palace of our lord the king , and they carried away everything that was found before them , the desirable and beautiful edifices of the city , whatever | 31 was near the river on the south and on the north of it .
</p>
        <p>
And they destroyed the temple of the church of the Christians .
</p>
        <p>
And there were killed by that occurrence more than two thousand men , upon many of whom as they slept in the night the waters came suddenly , and they were drowned , and the city was filled with the sound of lamentation .
</p>
        <p>
And when Abgar the king saw this destruction which had befallen , he commanded that all the craftsmen of the city should remove their cottages -LRB- or huts -RRB- from near the river , and that no man should build near the river any cottage .
</p>
        <p>
And by the wisdom of measurers and men of skill the cottages were placed so that the breadth of the river might be increased , and they added to its former measure .
</p>
        <p>
For if the waters were many and strong , the width of the river was too small to receive the water of twenty-five brooks with what they gathered from all sides .
</p>
        <p>
And Abgar the king commanded that all who lived in the porch , and were occupied over against the river , from <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/2392">Tis</a>hrin the former to Nisan -LRB- October to April -RRB- , should not lodge in their cottages , except the islanders -LRB- Gazireans -RRB- who kept the city , five of whom should lodge on the wall above the place where the waters entered the city all the time of winter , and when they perceived by night and heard the sound of strange waters , which began to enter the city , and whoever heard the sound and neglected it , and did not publish it , behold the waters should drown the contempt of him that despised the command of the king .
</p>
        <p>
And this commandment was decreed from this time wherein it was so to the end of the world .
</p>
        <p>
Our lord Abgar the king commanded , and there was built for him a building for his royal house -- a winter house at Tabara -- and there he dwelt all the time of winter ; and in summer he came down to the new palace which was built for him at the fountain head .
</p>
        <p>
And his nobles also built for themselves buildings to live in , in the neighbourhood in which the king was , in the high street -LRB- ? -RRB-
</p>
        <p>
which is called Beth Saharoye .
</p>
        <p>
And in order to restore the welfare of the former city , Abgar the king commanded , and the tributes due from those within , and from those who dwelt in towns , and in hamlets , were remitted : and tribute was not demanded from them for five years , until the city was enriched with men , and was crowned with buildings .
</p>
        <p>
Now Mar Yahab <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/2421">Bar Shemesh</a> , and Kajuma Bar Magartat , the scribes of Edessa , recorded this event , and the command of Abgar the king : and Bar Din and Bulid , who are prefects over the archives of Edessa , received and deposited it within them as trusted of the city -LRB- i.e. , archivists . -RRB-

The year 180 , i.e. of the Greeks , of the Seleucidae , or of the Syro-<a href="http://syriaca.org/place/512">Macedonia</a>ns , coincides , says Assemani , with B.C. 129 .
</p>
        <p>
Dionysius places the commencement of the Edessene kingdom in B.C. 136 , or , as he calls it , in the year of Abraham 1880 .
</p>
        <p>
-- `` The year 1880 of Abraham , there began to reign over <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> -LRB- Urhoi -RRB- the first King Orhoi , son of Hevia , five years , and after his name it was called Urhoi . ''

Abgar `` built a naphsho in honour of his death . ''
</p>
        <p>
The word naphsho is usually translated `` soul , '' or '' self , '' but is said sometimes to denote a sepulchre or mausoleum .
</p>
        <p>
Perhaps the word should be nauso , a shrine or temple .
</p>
        <p>
Assemani says this Abgar was Abgar Bar Ajazat , the nineteenth King of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> .
</p>
        <p>
Bayer thinks he was old when he began to reign , because he built a mausoleum for himself .

Marcion is joined with Manetes in the extracts from the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Chronicle quoted in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Miscellanies , p. 87 .

`` In the year 448 , Marcion and Manetes , heretics in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/1525">Phrygia</a> , were famous . ''

This is a year earlier than the date above given .

Other dates have been given for Bardesanes .
</p>
        <p>
Thus in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Miscellanies , p. 87 , we read that Bardesanes , who promulgated the doctrine of Valentinus , was famous or flourished in the year 479 .
</p>
        <p>
If he were only born in 465 -LRB- A.D. 154 -RRB- this can hardly be correct ; but other authorities clearly imply an earlier date than that of the Edessene Chronicle .
</p>
        <p>

</p>
        <p>
This event really occupies an earlier place in the chronicle under the year 449 , which Assemani says is wrong , and he has therefore corrected it .

This overthrow of the walls in 303 was also caused by a flood , as shewn by Dionysius in his chronicle , and as stated below .
</p>
        <p>
The account of Dionysius , as quoted by Assemani , is to this effect , -- '' In the year 614 of Alexander , <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> was taken by the waters , and its eastern walls were broken down and fell , and -LRB- the river -RRB- carried away and removed all that was in it ; and the flood made great havoc in it , both upon men and cattle , and in all the plain of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> and Haran .

Dionysius refers this restoration to Constantine .

The great baptistery may have stood where Mr. Badger says a mosque now stands , -- `` The mosque called Oloor Jamesi was an old Christian church , as is evident from the hexangular belfry which is now converted into a minaret , and from the lower parts of the building .
</p>
        <p>
As in the case of the Great Mosque at Diarbekir , the nave of the church has been turned into a court-yard , in which a fountain has been introduced for the religious ablutions of the Mussulmans ; and the southern wall of the church is now the northern wall of the mosque .
</p>
        <p>
The fountain is surmounted by a dome raised upon four Corinthian pillars taken from some more ancient building . ''

Certainly not in the same year as the death of Barses .
</p>
        <p>
It is not clear when these years begin .
</p>
        <p>
They are usually supposed to begin Sept. 1 , but our author seems to have some other day , as several of his entries suggest .
</p>
        <p>
Above in No. 31 he reckons September , as in the same year with the preceding June .

Assemani says this belongs to the year 690 .

        <p>
Mar Demet is rendered by Assemani as if it were a contraction of Domitius , `` Domus Mar Domitii . ''
</p>
        <p>
He prints it in italics , apparently as if in doubt .
</p>
        <p>
The vowels are as we give them , and therefore we prefer to think Demetrius is meant , both here and elsewhere -LRB- B. O. , i. , 215 -RRB- .

The second general council in A.D. 381 .
</p>
        <p>
It began in October , hence the author assigns it to 693 , and not 692 ; Assemani at least puts it in October , with which however others do not agree .
</p>
        <p>
Socrates assigns it to May ; and the very ancient MS. quoted in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Miscellanies -LRB- A.D. 500 -RRB- refers it to August .

        <p>
58 .
</p>
        <p>
For 742 the MS. had 744 , which Assemani corrected .
</p>
        <p>

</p>
        <p>
The weight of the table offered by Senator is put down at 720 litra , the same as the Latin libra , a pound of about twelve ounces avoirdupois .
</p>
        <p>
This would make about 540 lbs .
</p>
        <p>
avoirdupois .
</p>
        <p>
61 .
</p>
        <p>
In the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c we read that Anatol the Stratelates made a nauso of silver .
</p>
        <p>
The name Anatol is , of course , a shortened form of Anatolius , -- proper names are frequently abbreviated in | 43 this chronicle , but we have not always indicated the fact .
</p>
        <p>
The Nauso seems to be a mere variation of Naos , a temple or shrine .
</p>
        <p>
Christianity was now looking up the trappings of exploded idolatry .
</p>
        <p>
The reader will be reminded of the silver shrines of Artemis in Acts xix .
</p>
        <p>
24 , where the Greek has this very word , and so has the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Peshito .
</p>
        <p>
The other word Stratelates, a commander of soldiers , is as old as Sophocles and Euripides .
</p>
        <p>
63 .
</p>
        <p>
The second synod of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/623">Ephesus</a> , says Assemani , was held , not in 756 , but in 760 , or A.D. 449 .
</p>
        <p>
Although Ibas of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> was anathematised on that occasion , the fact is recorded without a remark .
</p>
        <p>
The bishop , we are told in the following article , left <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> on January 1st , 759 ; if , however , the synod was held in 760 , the bishop could not have been removed till the next year .
</p>
        <p>
Nounus , called Nono in the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c text , `` made a hierateion in the church . ''
</p>
        <p>
A `` hierateion '' is a `` locus sacer ac venerandus , tabulate inclusus , clericis tantum , viris saecularibus raro , mulieribus nunquam penetrabilis . ''
</p>
        <p>
65 .
</p>
        <p>
This reference to a `` bishop in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/2360">Rome</a> '' -LRB- as the Syriac has it -RRB- , is the first and only indication given by the chronicle that there were bishops there at all .
This reference to a `` bishop in Rome '' -LRB- as the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c has it -RRB- , is the first and only indication given by the chronicle that there were bishops there at all .
This reference to a `` bishop in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/641">Rome</a> '' -LRB- as the Syriac has it -RRB- , is the first and only indication given by the chronicle that there were bishops there at all .
</p>
        <p>
From first to last there is no sign of dependence upon <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/2360">Rome</a> , or of any connection with it .

</p>
        <p>
Mar Isaac is called an Archimandrite by Assemani , but the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c is `` head of a convent , '' or monastery , -- the Greek word is not used .
</p>
        <p>
68 .
</p>
        <p>
Ibas was restored and Nonnus removed ; but when Ibas died Nonnus resumed episcopal functions .
</p>
        <p>
Nonnus was no doubt a zealous churchman , for he not only made a sacristy in the church , he built the Church of John the Baptist , etc. .
</p>
        <p>
As Assemani renders it , he also built a `` nosocomium pauperum invalidorum extra portam Beth-Semes . ''
</p>
        <p>
The <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c is here peculiar , and might be rendered `` the field of the house of poor invalids . ''
</p>
        <p>
Michaelis says `` videtur significare hortos , subdio sed porticibus cinctos , in quibus obambulari aegroti poterant . ''
</p>
        <p>
Within this inclosure Nonnus built a church .
</p>
        <p>
His philanthropy and religious zeal further appear in his erection of convents , towers and bridges , and in the improvement of the highways .
</p>
        <p>
These things certainly indicate wealth , influence and public spirit .
</p>
        <p>
69 .
</p>
        <p>
The death of this famous enthusiast , whom Assemani calls `` Sanctissimum Stylitam , '' is said to have happened in the year 770 , or A.D. 459 .
</p>
        <p>
So the Chronicle quoted in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Miscellanies -LRB- p. 83 -RRB- , `` In 730 Mar Simeon ascended the pillar , and in 770 he died on the 2nd of Elul . ''
</p>
        <p>
74 .
</p>
        <p>
All artificers were required to pay a tax of one Aureus | 44 every fourth year .
</p>
        <p>
The taxes levied are enumerated in the extracts given by Assemani -LRB- B. O. , i. , 268 -RRB- , and are very curious , including horses , oxen , mules , asses , dogs , beggars , and dunghills .
</p>
        <p>
76 .
</p>
        <p>
The Syncelli were the personal attendants and assistants of the bishop .
</p>
        <p>
Assemani overlooks in his translation the clause about the sign which appeared in the sky , and which was probably a comet .
</p>
        <p>
79 .
</p>
        <p>
The great fire in the north was no doubt the aurora borealis .
</p>
        <p>
From this record we should infer that it is seldom seen in those parts .
</p>
        <p>
82 .
</p>
        <p>
The sabbath of the resurrection is , of course , the day before Easter Sunday .
</p>
        <p>
In the tables of lessons appended by Widmanstadt to his <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c Testament , the day after Good Friday is called the `` sabbath of the annunciation . ''
</p>
        <p>
83 .
</p>
        <p>
The receptacle in question was probably the shrine of St. Euphemia .
</p>
        <p>
According to Theophanes , the book was laid up in the altar , and was actually conveyed to the emperor .
</p>
        <p>
The miracle was of course an after-thought .
</p>
        <p>
87 .
</p>
        <p>
To this item Assemani appends the words `` exilio mulctavit , '' probably because he supposed this implied by the previous verb .
</p>
        <p>
89 .
</p>
        <p>
This Paul was Bishop of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> twice .
</p>
        <p>
The <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>ns call him an `` interpreter of books , '' either because he translated out of Greek into <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c , or because he wrote expositions of Scripture .
</p>
        <p>
Respecting him Assemani gives an interesting extract from John of Asia -LRB- or of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/623">Ephesus</a> -RRB- preserved by Dionysius in his Chronicle .
</p>
        <p>
The baptistery alluded to in the text is probably the one mentioned above , number 29 .
</p>
        <p>
90 .
</p>
        <p>
For `` December '' Assemani has `` October '' by mistake .
</p>
        <p>
Who were the oriental monks so summarily ejected ?
</p>
        <p>
They were monophysites , but how came they to be styled `` orientals '' at <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> ?
</p>
        <p>
92 .
</p>
        <p>
The remains of Asclepius were exhumed and transferred to <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> to be buried in the Church of St. Barlaha , upon or beside those of Nonnus .

        <p>
Ephraim of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/2254">Amid</a>a is called `` Comes Orientis , '' a dignity which he appears not to have retained , although Assemani passes over the verbs which we translate `` had been . ''
Ephraim of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/707">Amid</a>a is called `` Comes Orientis , '' a dignity which he appears not to have retained , although Assemani passes over the verbs which we translate `` had been . ''
Ephraim of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</a> is called `` Comes Orientis , '' a dignity which he appears not to have retained , although Assemani passes over the verbs which we translate `` had been . ''

The Huns who thus come upon the scene , it is needless to say , were Asiatic Tartars .

        <p>
Rufinus is called `` patricius '' or the patrician , a name borne by the presidents or prefects of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> .
</p>

        <p>
The word `` indiction '' occurs in the text .
</p>
        <p>
This mode of reckoning is often given in old <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c writers .
</p>
        <p>
Procopius | 45 says that a comet appeared in the thirteenth of Justinian , and hence Assemani infers that for 850 we should read 851 in the text .
</p>
        <p>
105 .
</p>
        <p><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/185">Shura</a> or Sura is mentioned by Procopius , De Aedific .

Surum .
</p>
        <p>
D'Anville places it on the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/82">Euphrates</a> , and with others calls it Sura .
</p>
        <p>
Procopius terms it Surwn polisma -- the town of Suron .
</p>
        <p>
The <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c word means usually `` a wall . ''
</p>
        <p>
Instead of two hundred pounds of gold , or , as the <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</a>c text has it , `` two centenaria of gold , '' Assemani writes `` duobus auri pondo , '' but surely `` pondo '' does not equal `` centenaria ; '' probably we should read `` ducentis auri pondo . ''
</p>
        <p>
106 .
</p>
        <p>
This Chronicle is followed in Assemani by a list of the kings of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> , and a list of its bishops from A.D. 313 to 769 .
</p>
        <p>
We may note that the Chronicle mentions no Bishop of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> before Conon , `` who laid the foundation of the Church of <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> '' in A.D. 313 .
</p>
        <p>
But we must not misinterpret this indication .
</p>
        <p>
There had long been Christians in <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> , as authentic records prove .
</p>
        <p>
Not only so , this very Chronicle , in recording the overthrow of the city by water in 513 -LRB- A.D. 202 -RRB- , mentions the destruction of the `` temple of the church of the Christians . ''
</p>
        <p>
This remarkable phrase shews not only that the disciples had a house of worship then , but that it was called a temple .
</p>
        <p>
More than this , the Christian community seems to monopolize the word Church , which was not yet applied to the building in which they assembled .
</p>
        <p>
Assemani observes that the words under notice shew that the Archivists were still heathen , although the king was a Christian , as Eusebius notes from Africanus -LRB- in Chron -RRB- .
</p>
        <p>
Conon , above-named , refounded the church at <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> , and hoped to rebuild it , but this work was accomplished by his successor .
</p>
        <p>
It can hardly be supposed that the reference is to the restoration of the `` temple '' destroyed in A.D. 202 ; it is rather to what is called `` the old church '' in number 60 ; restored by Justinian with immense splendour .
